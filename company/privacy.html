                                        Many web browsers, as well as certain mobile operating systems and applications, offer a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") option, which allows you to express a preference against having your online browsing activities observed and collected. However, currently, there is no consistent industry standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals. Consequently, our systems do not recognize DNT browser signals or any similar mechanisms that automatically indicate your decision against online tracking. Should a universally accepted standard for online tracking emerge that requires our compliance, we will update our practices accordingly and provide you with details in an updated version of this privacy notice.

                        <b>Verification process</b><br>

                        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
                         <br><br>
                        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
